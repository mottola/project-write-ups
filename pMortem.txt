I created a simple user-authentication app because I was having a difficult time with the slack clone.

My user authentication application helped me understand the separation of data, such as using a views folder for what the user can see and a models folder for data modeling.

I used several new node packages (which I looked up) to help figure out how to handle user registration and verification.

The app allows someone to visit the /secret page if they are logged in, but the page won't appear if they are not logged in.

The most frustrating part was definitely trying to comprehend how things are linked to each other, and how data is passed and shared across files.

I feel that in the future, once I figure out how to do something, like a new lightbulb moment, I should stop whatever I am doing and utilize that new knowledge several times. For instance, figuring out how to incorporate whether or not a user was logged in was difficult, and I eventually figured it out. However, I don't feel like I have it down. In the future I will make sure I can retain that new knowledge for future use.
